[[Ownable]]
== `Ownable`

Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
specific functions.

This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
`onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
the owner.

[[Ownable-onlyOwner--]]
=== onlyOwner()

Throws if called by any account other than the owner.

[[Ownable-constructor--]]
=== constructor()

Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.

[[Ownable-owner--]]
=== owner() → address

Returns the address of the current owner.

[[Ownable-isOwner--]]
=== isOwner() → bool

Returns true if the caller is the current owner.

[[Ownable-renounceOwnership--]]
=== renounceOwnership()

Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call
`onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner.

NOTE: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner,
thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

[[Ownable-transferOwnership-address-]]
=== transferOwnership(address newOwner)

Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`).
Can only be called by the current owner.

[[Ownable-_transferOwnership-address-]]
=== _transferOwnership(address newOwner)

Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`).

[[Ownable-OwnershipTransferred-address-address-]]
=== OwnershipTransferred(address previousOwner, address newOwner)
