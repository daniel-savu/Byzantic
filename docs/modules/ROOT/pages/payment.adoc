[[PaymentSplitter]]
== `PaymentSplitter`

This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.

The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.

`PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
function.

[[PaymentSplitter-constructor-address---uint256---]]
=== constructor(address[] payees, uint256[] shares)

Creates an instance of `PaymentSplitter` where each account in `payees` is assigned the number of shares at
the matching position in the `shares` array.

All addresses in `payees` must be non-zero. Both arrays must have the same non-zero length, and there must be no
duplicates in `payees`.

[[PaymentSplitter-fallback--]]
=== fallback()

The Ether received will be logged with {PaymentReceived} events. Note that these events are not fully
reliable: it's possible for a contract to receive Ether without triggering this function. This only affects the
reliability of the events, and not the actual splitting of Ether.

To learn more about this see the Solidity documentation for
https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#fallback-function[fallback
functions].

[[PaymentSplitter-totalShares--]]
=== totalShares() → uint256

Getter for the total shares held by payees.

[[PaymentSplitter-totalReleased--]]
=== totalReleased() → uint256

Getter for the total amount of Ether already released.

[[PaymentSplitter-shares-address-]]
=== shares(address account) → uint256

Getter for the amount of shares held by an account.

[[PaymentSplitter-released-address-]]
=== released(address account) → uint256

Getter for the amount of Ether already released to a payee.

[[PaymentSplitter-payee-uint256-]]
=== payee(uint256 index) → address

Getter for the address of the payee number `index`.

[[PaymentSplitter-release-address-payable-]]
=== release(address payable account)

Triggers a transfer to `account` of the amount of Ether they are owed, according to their percentage of the
total shares and their previous withdrawals.

[[PullPayment]]
== `PullPayment`

Simple implementation of a
https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls[pull-payment]
strategy, where the paying contract doesn't interact directly with the
receiver account, which must withdraw its payments itself.

Pull-payments are often considered the best practice when it comes to sending
Ether, security-wise. It prevents recipients from blocking execution, and
eliminates reentrancy concerns.

TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
to protect against it, check out our blog post
https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul].

To use, derive from the `PullPayment` contract, and use {_asyncTransfer}
instead of Solidity's `transfer` function. Payees can query their due
payments with {payments}, and retrieve them with {withdrawPayments}.

[[PullPayment-constructor--]]
=== constructor()



[[PullPayment-withdrawPayments-address-payable-]]
=== withdrawPayments(address payable payee)

Withdraw accumulated payments.

Note that _any_ account can call this function, not just the `payee`.
This means that contracts unaware of the `PullPayment` protocol can still
receive funds this way, by having a separate account call
{withdrawPayments}.

NOTE: This function has been deprecated, use {withdrawPaymentsWithGas}
instead. Calling contracts with fixed gas limits is an anti-pattern and
may break contract interactions in network upgrades (hardforks).

[[PullPayment-withdrawPaymentsWithGas-address-payable-]]
=== withdrawPaymentsWithGas(address payable payee)

Same as {withdrawPayments}, but forwarding all gas to the recipient.

WARNING: Forwarding all gas opens the door to reentrancy vulnerabilities.
Make sure you trust the recipient, or are either following the
checks-effects-interactions pattern or using {ReentrancyGuard}.

_Available since v2.4.0._

[[PullPayment-payments-address-]]
=== payments(address dest) → uint256

Returns the payments owed to an address.


[[PullPayment-_asyncTransfer-address-uint256-]]
=== _asyncTransfer(address dest, uint256 amount)

Called by the payer to store the sent amount as credit to be pulled.
Funds sent in this way are stored in an intermediate {Escrow} contract, so
there is no danger of them being spent before withdrawal.

[[Escrow]]
== `Escrow`

Base escrow contract, holds funds designated for a payee until they
withdraw them.

Intended usage: This contract (and derived escrow contracts) should be a
standalone contract, that only interacts with the contract that instantiated
it. That way, it is guaranteed that all Ether will be handled according to
the `Escrow` rules, and there is no need to check for payable functions or
transfers in the inheritance tree. The contract that uses the escrow as its
payment method should be its primary, and provide public methods redirecting
to the escrow's deposit and withdraw.

contract interactions in network upgrades (hardforks).

[[RefundEscrow]]
== `RefundEscrow`

Escrow that holds funds for a beneficiary, deposited from multiple
parties.
Intended usage: See {Escrow}. Same usage guidelines apply here.
The primary account (that is, the contract that instantiates this
contract) may deposit, close the deposit period, and allow for either
withdrawal by the beneficiary, or refunds to the depositors. All interactions
with `RefundEscrow` will be made through the primary contract. See the
`RefundableCrowdsale` contract for an example of `RefundEscrow`’s use.
