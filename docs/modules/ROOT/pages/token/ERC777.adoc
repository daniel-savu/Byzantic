= ERC 777
This set of interfaces and contracts are all related to the [ERC777 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777).

TIP: For an overview of ERC777 tokens and a walkthrough on how to create a token contract read our xref:ROOT:tokens.adoc#ERC777[ERC777 guide].

The token behavior itself is implemented in the core contracts: {IERC777}, {ERC777}.

Additionally there are interfaces used to develop contracts that react to token movements: {IERC777Sender}, {IERC777Recipient}.

Interface of the ERC777Token standard as defined in the EIP.

This contract uses the
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820[ERC1820 registry standard] to let
token holders and recipients react to token movements by using setting implementers
for the associated interfaces in said registry. See {IERC1820Registry} and
{ERC1820Implementer}.

[[IERC777-name--]]
=== name() → string

Returns the name of the token.

[[IERC777-symbol--]]
=== symbol() → string

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name.

[[IERC777-granularity--]]
=== granularity() → uint256

Returns the smallest part of the token that is not divisible. This
means all token operations (creation, movement and destruction) must have
amounts that are a multiple of this number.

For most token contracts, this value will equal 1.

[[IERC777-totalSupply--]]
=== totalSupply() → uint256

Returns the amount of tokens in existence.

[[IERC777-balanceOf-address-]]
=== balanceOf(address owner) → uint256

Returns the amount of tokens owned by an account (`owner`).

[[IERC777-send-address-uint256-bytes-]]
=== send(address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes data)

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.

If send or receive hooks are registered for the caller and `recipient`,
the corresponding functions will be called with `data` and empty
`operatorData`. See {IERC777Sender} and {IERC777Recipient}.

Emits a {Sent} event.

Requirements

- the caller must have at least `amount` tokens.
- `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
- if `recipient` is a contract, it must implement the {IERC777Recipient}
interface.

[[IERC777-burn-uint256-bytes-]]
=== burn(uint256 amount, bytes data)

Destroys `amount` tokens from the caller's account, reducing the
total supply.

If a send hook is registered for the caller, the corresponding function
will be called with `data` and empty `operatorData`. See {IERC777Sender}.

Emits a {Burned} event.

Requirements

- the caller must have at least `amount` tokens.

[[IERC777-isOperatorFor-address-address-]]
=== isOperatorFor(address operator, address tokenHolder) → bool

Returns true if an account is an operator of `tokenHolder`.
Operators can send and burn tokens on behalf of their owners. All
accounts are their own operator.

See {operatorSend} and {operatorBurn}.

[[IERC777-authorizeOperator-address-]]
=== authorizeOperator(address operator)

Make an account an operator of the caller.

See {isOperatorFor}.

Emits an {AuthorizedOperator} event.

Requirements

- `operator` cannot be calling address.

[[IERC777-revokeOperator-address-]]
=== revokeOperator(address operator)

Make an account an operator of the caller.

See {isOperatorFor} and {defaultOperators}.

Emits a {RevokedOperator} event.

Requirements

- `operator` cannot be calling address.

[[IERC777-defaultOperators--]]
=== defaultOperators() → address[]

Returns the list of default operators. These accounts are operators
for all token holders, even if {authorizeOperator} was never called on
them.

This list is immutable, but individual holders may revoke these via
{revokeOperator}, in which case {isOperatorFor} will return false.

[[IERC777-operatorSend-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-]]
=== operatorSend(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData)

Moves `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient`. The caller must
be an operator of `sender`.

If send or receive hooks are registered for `sender` and `recipient`,
the corresponding functions will be called with `data` and
`operatorData`. See {IERC777Sender} and {IERC777Recipient}.

Emits a {Sent} event.

Requirements

- `sender` cannot be the zero address.
- `sender` must have at least `amount` tokens.
- the caller must be an operator for `sender`.
- `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
- if `recipient` is a contract, it must implement the {IERC777Recipient}
interface.

[[IERC777-operatorBurn-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-]]
=== operatorBurn(address account, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData)

Destoys `amount` tokens from `account`, reducing the total supply.
The caller must be an operator of `account`.

If a send hook is registered for `account`, the corresponding function
will be called with `data` and `operatorData`. See {IERC777Sender}.

Emits a {Burned} event.

Requirements

- `account` cannot be the zero address.
- `account` must have at least `amount` tokens.
- the caller must be an operator for `account`.

[[ERC777]]
== `ERC777`

Implementation of the {IERC777} interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both
the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.
Both {IERC777-Sent} and {IERC20-Transfer} events are emitted on token
movements.

Additionally, the {IERC777-granularity} value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there
are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or
destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.

:tokensToSend: pass:normal[xref:#IERC777Sender-tokensToSend-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-[`tokensToSend`]]

[[IERC777Sender]]
== `IERC777Sender`

Interface of the ERC777TokensSender standard as defined in the EIP.

{IERC777} Token holders can be notified of operations performed on their
tokens by having a contract implement this interface (contract holders can be
their own implementer) and registering it on the
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820[ERC1820 global registry].

See {IERC1820Registry} and {ERC1820Implementer}.


- xref:#IERC777Sender-tokensToSend-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-[tokensToSend(address,address,address,uint256,bytes,bytes)]


[[IERC777Sender-tokensToSend-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-]]
=== tokensToSend(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData)

Called by an {IERC777} token contract whenever a registered holder's
(`from`) tokens are about to be moved or destroyed. The type of operation
is conveyed by `to` being the zero address or not.

This call occurs _before_ the token contract's state is updated, so
{IERC777-balanceOf}, etc., can be used to query the pre-operation state.

This function may revert to prevent the operation from being executed.



:IERC777Recipient: pass:normal[xref:#IERC777Recipient[`IERC777Recipient`]]
:tokensReceived: pass:normal[xref:#IERC777Recipient-tokensReceived-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-[`tokensReceived`]]

[[IERC777Recipient]]
== `IERC777Recipient`

Interface of the ERC777TokensRecipient standard as defined in the EIP.

Accounts can be notified of {IERC777} tokens being sent to them by having a
contract implement this interface (contract holders can be their own
implementer) and registering it on the
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820[ERC1820 global registry].

See {IERC1820Registry} and {ERC1820Implementer}.


- xref:#IERC777Recipient-tokensReceived-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-[tokensReceived(address,address,address,uint256,bytes,bytes)]


[[IERC777Recipient-tokensReceived-address-address-address-uint256-bytes-bytes-]]
=== tokensReceived(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData)

Called by an {IERC777} token contract whenever tokens are being
moved or created into a registered account (`to`). The type of operation
is conveyed by `from` being the zero address or not.

This call occurs _after_ the token contract's state is updated, so
{IERC777-balanceOf}, etc., can be used to query the post-operation state.

This function may revert to prevent the operation from being executed.
