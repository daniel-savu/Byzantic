= ERC 20

This set of interfaces, contracts, and utilities are all related to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20[ERC20 Token Standard].

TIP: For an overview of ERC20 tokens and a walkthrough on how to create a token contract read our xref:ROOT:tokens.adoc#ERC20[ERC20 guide].

There a few core contracts that implement the behavior specified in the EIP:

* {IERC20}: the interface all ERC20 implementations should conform to
* {ERC20}: the base implementation of the ERC20 interface
* {ERC20Detailed}: includes the <<ERC20Detailed-name,`name`>>,
   <<ERC20Detailed-symbol,`symbol`>> and <<ERC20Detailed-decimals,`decimals`>>
   optional standard extension to the base interface

Additionally there are multiple custom extensions, including:

* designation of addresses that can create token supply ({ERC20Mintable}), with an optional maximum cap ({ERC20Capped})
* destruction of own tokens ({ERC20Burnable})
* designation of addresses that can pause token operations for all users ({ERC20Pausable}).

Finally, there are some utilities to interact with ERC20 contracts in various ways.

* {SafeERC20} is a wrapper around the interface that eliminates the need to handle boolean return values.
* {TokenTimelock} can hold tokens for a beneficiary until a specified time.

NOTE: This page is incomplete. We're working to improve it for the next release. Stay tuned!

[[IERC20-totalSupply--]]
=== totalSupply() → uint256

Returns the amount of tokens in existence.

[[IERC20-balanceOf-address-]]
=== balanceOf(address account) → uint256

Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.

[[IERC20-transfer-address-uint256-]]
=== transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

[[IERC20-allowance-address-address-]]
=== allowance(address owner, address spender) → uint256

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}. This is
zero by default.

This value changes when {approve} or {transferFrom} are called.

[[IERC20-approve-address-uint256-]]
=== approve(address spender, uint256 amount) → bool

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729

Emits an {Approval} event.

[[IERC20-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-]]
=== transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) → bool

Moves `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient` using the
allowance mechanism. `amount` is then deducted from the caller's
allowance.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

[[IERC20-Transfer-address-address-uint256-]]
=== Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)

Emitted when `value` tokens are moved from one account (`from`) to
another (`to`).

Note that `value` may be zero.

[[IERC20-Approval-address-address-uint256-]]
=== Approval(address owner, address spender, uint256 value)

Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by
a call to {approve}. `value` is the new allowance.

[[ERC20]]
== `ERC20`

Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
For a generic mechanism see {ERC20Mintable}.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
to implement supply mechanisms].

We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.

Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

[[ERC20Detailed-constructor-string-string-uint8-]]
=== constructor(string name, string symbol, uint8 decimals)

Sets the values for `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`. All three of
these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
construction.

[[ERC20Detailed-name--]]
=== name() → string

Returns the name of the token.

[[ERC20Detailed-symbol--]]
=== symbol() → string

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name.

[[ERC20Detailed-decimals--]]
=== decimals() → uint8

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei.

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.

[[ERC20Capped-constructor-uint256-]]
=== constructor(uint256 cap)

Sets the value of the `cap`. This value is immutable, it can only be
set once during construction.

[[ERC20Capped-cap--]]
=== cap() → uint256

Returns the cap on the token's total supply.

[[ERC20Capped-_mint-address-uint256-]]
=== _mint(address account, uint256 value)

See {ERC20Mintable-mint}.

Requirements:

- `value` must not cause the total supply to go over the cap.

[[SafeERC20]]
== `SafeERC20`

Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token
contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or
throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be
successful.
To use this library you can add a `using SafeERC20 for ERC20;` statement to your contract,
which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(...)`, etc.

[[TokenTimelock]]
== `TokenTimelock`

A token holder contract that will allow a beneficiary to extract the
tokens after a given release time.

Useful for simple vesting schedules like "advisors get all of their tokens
after 1 year".

For a more complete vesting schedule, see {TokenVesting}.
